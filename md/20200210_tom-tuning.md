# Vinnie, Dave,...

A general rule that works for almost ny kit, single or double ply batter, most versatile sound for studio use this:
reso head a minor third higher than the batter head.

Tons of drummer use it.

If you want a specific note as fundamental, go down a semitone for the resonant and three more for the batter (harmonic on higher octave).
Might want to raise a bit the resonant for bigger toms and losen ist up for smaller ones, depending on the shell depth.


| Tom Size | Fundamental | Batter   | Reso     |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- |
|  10"     | E  164Hz	 | C  262Hz | Eb 311Hz |
|  12"     | B  124Hz    | G  196Hz | Bb 233Hz |
|  14"     | E   82Hz    | C  131Hz | Eb 158Hz |
|  16"     | B   62Hz    | G   98Hz | Bb 118Hz |
